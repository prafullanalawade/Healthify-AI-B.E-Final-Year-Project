# Healthify-AI

**Advanced AI-Driven Solution for Human Diseases Management**
*SPPU B.E. A.I.-D.S. Final Year Project (2025)*

---

## 🧠 Overview

**Healthify-AI** is an intelligent, user-friendly web application designed to assist users in predicting **Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Kidney Disease** using machine learning models. The platform also provides visual insights into user health data, an AI-powered chatbot for instant health guidance, and location-based services to help users find nearby hospitals and clinics.

The goal of this project is to make healthcare insights more accessible, interactive, and data-driven through artificial intelligence.
